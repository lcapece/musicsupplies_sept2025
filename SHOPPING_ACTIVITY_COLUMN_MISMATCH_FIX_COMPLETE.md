# Shopping Activity Column Mismatch Fix - COMPLETE

## Issue
The application was experiencing a database error when trying to track shopping activity:
- Error: "Column 'shopping_activity.account_id' cannot be null"
- The code was trying to insert data with columns `action` and `product_sku`
- But the table only had `activity_type` and `activity_data` columns

## Root Cause
There was a mismatch between:
1. What the application code expected (columns: `account_id`, `action`, `product_sku`, `session_id`)
2. What the database table had (columns: `account_id`, `activity_type`, `activity_data`, etc.)

## Solution Implemented

### Database Changes
1. **Added missing columns**:
   - `action` VARCHAR(100) - to store the type of action (view, add_to_cart, etc.)
   - `product_sku` VARCHAR(255) - to store the product SKU/part number

2. **Made account_id nullable**:
   - Allows guest users (not logged in) to have their activity tracked
   - Prevents null constraint violations for anonymous users

3. **Updated RLS policies**:
   - Added policy to allow both `authenticated` and `anon` roles to insert
   - This enables tracking for both logged-in and guest users

4. **Added indexes** for performance:
   - `idx_shopping_activity_action`
   - `idx_shopping_activity_product_sku`

### Data Migration
- If any existing data had `activity_type`, it was copied to the new `action` column
- If any existing data had `product_sku` in the JSONB `activity_data`, it was extracted to the new column

## Files Changed
- Created: `supabase/migrations/20250813_fix_shopping_activity_table_structure.sql`
- Applied via Supabase MCP

## Impact
- Guest users can now browse without errors
- Shopping activity tracking works for both authenticated and anonymous users
- The table structure now matches what the application code expects
- No changes to frontend code were required

## Verification
The migration was successfully applied to the hosted Supabase database. The application should now:
1. Allow guest users to browse products without errors
2. Track shopping activity for logged-in users with their account_id
3. Track shopping activity for guest users with null account_id
