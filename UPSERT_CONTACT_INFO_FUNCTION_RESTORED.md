        p_business_phone,
        p_mobile_phone
    )
    ON CONFLICT (account_number) DO UPDATE SET
        email_address = COALESCE(EXCLUDED.email_address, contactinfo.email_address),
        business_phone = COALESCE(EXCLUDED.business_phone, contactinfo.business_phone),
        mobile_phone = COALESCE(EXCLUDED.mobile_phone, contactinfo.mobile_phone),
        updated_at = NOW()
