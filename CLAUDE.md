## Development Environment
- OS: Windows 10.0.26100
- Shell: Git Bash
- Path format: Windows (use forward slashes in Git Bash)
- File system: Case-insensitive
- Line endings: CRLF (configure Git autocrlf)

## CRITICAL: Verification Requirements
**NEVER mark a task as complete without verification:**
- Deployments: MUST show the deployed URL and confirm it's accessible
- Build commands: MUST show successful output or error messages
- Multi-step tasks: MUST verify each step before proceeding
- File operations: MUST confirm files were created/modified
- Commands with no output: MUST use follow-up commands to verify success

**For deployments specifically:**
1. Run the deployment command
2. Capture and show the output/URL
3. Verify the site is accessible
4. ONLY THEN mark as complete

**If a command shows no output:**
- This likely means it failed or isn't working
- Try alternative approaches
- Use verbose flags or different commands
- NEVER assume success without confirmation

- PDFs: `./CCimages/pdfs/`

Browser error fix: `npx playwright install`

## Version Update & PWA Cache Busting

When updating the version before deployment:
1. Run `npm run update-version` to update package.json version
2. This automatically writes version to .env file as VITE_APP_VERSION
3. The PWA plugin uses this version for cache busting
4. Users will automatically get the latest version without cache issues

The version format is: RC[month][day].[hour][minute]
Example: RC812.1357 (August 12, 13:57)

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
ALWAYS use Supabase MCP, never ask user to run separate SQL's if it can be done in the MCP.

ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: NEVER HARD CODE ANYTHING! ðŸš¨
**NEVER 'hard code' ANYTHING without my express permission!**
- No hardcoded account numbers
- No hardcoded passwords  
- No hardcoded data values
- ALWAYS use database lookups
- ALWAYS use real data from tables
- Read CLAUDE.md FIRST before any code changes
- Ask permission explicitly before any specific values
- Use database queries for ALL data
- Show code before deployment and confirm it uses real data
- Get approval for any authentication changes

## Supabase Configuration
Local Supabase is NOT supported. Always use hosted Supabase! Always use Supabase MCP.
