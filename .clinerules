# Project-Specific Cline Rules


## CRITICAL REMINDER: DO NOT RUN ANY "TESTS" SUCH AS BROWSER USE, ETC THAT REQUIRE INVOKING 'NPM RUN DEV'

## CRITICAL: DO NOT RUN PLAYWRIGHT MCP UNLESS GIVEN PERMISSON IN ADVANCE!

## CRITICAL REMINDER: SUPABASE MCP IS AVAILABLE!




Before attempting ANY Supabase-related task:
1. CHECK if there's an MCP tool that can do it directly
2. USE the MCP tool instead of creating scripts or manual instructions
3. The Supabase MCP is connected at: github.com/supabase-community/supabase-mcp

Common MCP tools to remember:
- `deploy_edge_function` - Deploy edge functions WITHOUT Docker
- `apply_migration` - Apply SQL migrations directly
- `execute_sql` - Run SQL queries directly
- `get_logs` - Check service logs

STOP defaulting to CLI commands and batch files when MCP tools are available!

## ðŸš¨ NEVER USE LOCAL SUPABASE! ðŸš¨

**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:**
- NEVER run `supabase` CLI commands locally
- NEVER attempt local database connections (127.0.0.1:54322)
- NEVER use `supabase migration up` or similar local commands
- NEVER create batch files that run local Supabase commands

**ALWAYS USE:**
- Supabase MCP tools for hosted database operations
- Only work on HOSTED/REMOTE Supabase via MCP
- If MCP is unavailable, provide SQL scripts for manual execution

**VIOLATION OF THIS RULE IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED!**
