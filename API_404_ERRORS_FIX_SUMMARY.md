# API 404 Errors - Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis
The console errors showed multiple 404 API endpoints failing:

1. `get_system_logs` - System event logging (SystemLogTab.tsx:108)
2. `get_cart_activity_admin` - Cart activity tracking  
3. `get_all_cart_contents` - Active cart monitoring
4. `set_config` - Configuration settings
5. `get_sms_failures` - SMS failure tracking
6. Various SMS-related endpoints

## Root Cause
These RPC functions and supporting database tables were not deployed to the live Supabase instance, causing all API calls to return 404 errors.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Comprehensive Migration
File: `supabase/migrations/20250827_fix_missing_functions_comprehensive.sql`

**New Database Tables:**
- `app_events` - System event logs with full metadata
- `cart_activity` - Shopping cart activity tracking
- `product_views` - Product browsing history  
- `sms_failures` - SMS error tracking and retry management
- `system_config` - Application configuration storage

**New RPC Functions:**
- `get_system_logs()` - Retrieve filtered system events (admin only)
- `get_cart_activity_admin()` - Get cart activity history (admin only)
- `get_all_cart_contents()` - View active carts across all users (admin only)
- `set_config() / get_config()` - System configuration management (admin only)
- `log_sms_failure() / get_sms_failures()` - SMS error tracking (admin only)

**Security Features:**
- Admin-only access (account 999) with SECURITY DEFINER
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Service role access for edge functions
- Comprehensive permissions and policies

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Strategic indexes on frequently queried columns
- Optimized query patterns for large datasets
- Efficient cart aggregation logic

### 2. Created Deployment Script
File: `apply_comprehensive_migration.ps1`

- Automated PowerShell script for migration deployment
- Environment variable integration (.env file)
- Error handling and success confirmation
- Detailed output showing created resources

## Expected Results

After migration completion, the following 404 errors should be resolved:

✅ SystemLogTab system event loading
✅ Cart activity tracking in admin panel
✅ Active cart monitoring functionality  
✅ System configuration management
✅ SMS failure tracking and reporting
✅ ElevenLabs voice integration endpoints
✅ General RPC configuration errors

## Files Created/Modified

1. `supabase/migrations/20250827_fix_missing_functions_comprehensive.sql` - Main migration
2. `apply_comprehensive_migration.ps1` - Deployment script  
3. `API_404_ERRORS_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Migration script execution (currently running)
2. ⏳ Verify migration success in terminal output
3. ⏳ Test SystemLogTab functionality in admin dashboard
4. ⏳ Verify all 404 errors are resolved in browser console
5. ⏳ Test cart activity tracking and other admin functions

## Technical Details

The migration uses PostgreSQL's `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` patterns to ensure safe deployment without conflicts. All functions include proper error handling and admin authentication checks.

Database performance is optimized with targeted indexes on:
- Time-based queries (occurred_at, activity_at, failed_at)
- Account-based filtering (account_number)
- Event type filtering (event_type)

Row Level Security ensures data protection while allowing admin functions to operate with elevated privileges via `SECURITY DEFINER`.
