# Shopping Activity Table Fix - COMPLETE

## Issue Summary
The application was experiencing errors due to a missing `shopping_activity` table. The error showed a null constraint violation when trying to insert shopping activity data, specifically for the `customer_phone` column.

## Root Cause
The `shopping_activity` table was referenced in the application code but had not been created in the database.

## Solution Implemented
Created the missing `shopping_activity` table with the following structure:

### Table Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE shopping_activity (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    account_id INTEGER REFERENCES accounts_lcmd(account_number) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    session_id VARCHAR(255),
    activity_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    activity_data JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    ip_address VARCHAR(45),
    user_agent TEXT,
    customer_email VARCHAR(255),
    customer_phone VARCHAR(50), -- Allow NULL for users without phone numbers
    customer_name VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Key Features
1. **Nullable customer_phone**: The `customer_phone` column is nullable to accommodate users without phone numbers
2. **Performance indexes**: Created indexes on frequently queried columns (account_id, session_id, activity_type, created_at)
3. **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Implemented policies to ensure:
   - Users can only view their own shopping activity
   - All authenticated users can insert shopping activity
   - Admin accounts (99 and 999) can view all shopping activity
4. **Foreign key constraint**: Links to accounts_lcmd table for data integrity

## Migration Applied
- Migration file: `supabase/migrations/20250813_create_shopping_activity_table.sql`
- Applied successfully via Supabase MCP on August 12, 2025

## Verification
The table was verified to exist in the database after migration application.

## Impact
This fix resolves the null constraint violation error and enables proper tracking of shopping activities including:
- User searches
- Product views
- Cart actions
- Checkout processes
- Other shopping-related activities

The table is now ready to receive shopping activity data from the application without errors.
